<h3 class="text_center">Information Retrieval in RDF-Data Survey</h3>

<!-- What and how -->
<div class="about_text_container">
    <p>This survey is a part of the master thesis of Martin Gjerde and Ebba Fingarsen. It aims to compare 3 different search methods on two datasets of structured RDF-data.</p>

    <p>We will not keep any information about who is completing the survey. 
        The goal of the survey is not to test you, and there are no right or wrong answers. 
        The aim is to assess the users' percieved performance of different search methods.</p>
    
    <h4 class="information_title">What will you do?</h4>
    <p>You will be presented with a query and the information need/intent behind the query. 
        Your task is to rate how relevant you perceive each result, given to be compared to the given query and intent.</p>
    <p>Each result should be ranked with a score on a scale of 0-3 where 0 is not relevant and 3 is relevant.
        Each result has to be given a rating before you can submit the answer.
    </p>

    <p><i>ADD SIMPLE EXAMPLE ??</i></p>


    <h4 class="information_title">How long will it take?</h4>
    <p>The survey consists of <b>X</b> queries distributed equally on two datasets. 
        Each query is represented by a maximum of 10 results.
    </p>
    <p>You can at any time take a break and come back to the survey at a later point if you wish to do so. All completed queries assists our evaluation.
        The estimated time for completion is <b>X</b>min, but the time used may vary.</p>
